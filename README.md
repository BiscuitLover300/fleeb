# fleeb
Our group project


For the front end we will be using vscode, vss, and html to build a website to access our sudo merch website, fleeb.
our backend will consist of mongo-db and html interaction.
in our database, the information of usernames, passwords, unique userID created for each account, and eventually card information will be saved to it.
we will have secure setup for the more sensitive information by using https and httpsgit.
